# Lexical Analyser

Lexical Analysis is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. A program or function that performs  lexical analysis is called a lexical analyzer, scanner or lexer. 

Lexical Analyzer in Compiler:

Lexical Analyzer is part of the compiler that reads the source text and performs the following tasks:
•	Stripping out comments and whitespaces.
•	Identification of lexemes.
•	Lexical analyzer keep track of the number of newline characters  seen, so it can associate a line number with each error message.
•	Correlating error messages generated by compiler to source program.
•	For some programs that uses macro preprocessor , the expansion of macros is performed by lexical analyzer.



Given a program in java and python the lexical analyzer  should do the following:
•	It  should identify all the keywords.
•	It should identify all the identifiers.
•	It should identify all the literals( integer, float, string, character)
